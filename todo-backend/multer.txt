MULTER
-- When a client uploads a file (like an image, video, or document) via a form in HTML with enctype="multipart/form-data", Express can't handle that data directly. That's where multer comes in — it parses the form data and stores the file on your server (or in memory, depending on configuration).
✅ Key Features:
1. Handles file uploads (single or multiple).
2. Saves uploaded files to disk, memory, or can be connected to cloud storage.
3. Gives access to file metadata like name, size, mimetype, etc.


Do this:
in the edit-home form section
<form action ="/host/<%=editing ? "edit-home" : "add-home" %>" method="POST" enctype = "multipart/form-data"
